pgloggingfilter
===============

pgloggingfilter is a filter module for PostgreSQL logging.  It can be used
to suppress logging of various expected errors which is especially useful in
cases where users are allowed to call stored procedures with potentially
invalid arguments.

To enable pgloggingfilter it needs to be included in postgresql.conf's
shared_preload_libraries list after which control minimum error levels for
logging per sqlstate using the two new GUCs, for example:

  pgloggingfilter.log_min_messages_by_sqlstate = '22012:PANIC'
  pgloggingfilter.log_min_error_statement_by_sqlstate = 'P0001:PANIC,23503:PANIC'

would set the minimum error level for logging division by zero errors to
PANIC essentially disabling their logging and also prevent statements
causing PL/pgSQL 'RAISE EXCEPTION' and foreign key violations from being
logged.

Note that this module can only increase the minimum error level from the
base values set with log_min_messages and log_min_error_statement - i.e.
if statement logging is not globally enabled this module can't enable it
for any SQLSTATEs.

See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/errcodes-appendix.html for
the list of SQLSTATEs.
