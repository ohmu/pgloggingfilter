pgloggingfilter
===============

pgloggingfilter is a filter module for PostgreSQL logging.  It can be used
to suppress logging of various expected errors which is especially useful in
cases where users are allowed to call stored procedures with potentially
invalid arguments.

This was originally proposed as a core feature, see
https://commitfest.postgresql.org/action/patch_view?id=1360
